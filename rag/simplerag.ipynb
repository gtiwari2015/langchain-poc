We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\n…\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you.

It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10. (Image source: Google Blog, 2020)\\nCheck more MIPS algorithms and performance comparison in ann-benchmarks.com.\\nComponent Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Hambrick \\n Albert A. Cannella, Jr. \\n Columbia University \\n Today\\'s strategists are at no loss for concepts and tech- \\n niques to help them formulate strategies. Over the past \\n 15 years, consultants and academic researchers have intro- \\n duced a variety of powerful and pragmatic tools for answer- \\n ing the question, \"Where and how should we compete?\" \\n Tools such as industry and competitor analysis, portfolio \\n models, product life-cycle theory, and internal strength and \\n weakness analysis have gained widespread use.1 Many exec- \\n utives now express satisfaction with the methods used to \\n derive their business strategies. \\n But many of these \"best-laid plans\" are failing to see \\n the light of day. Plans to innovate fizzle out after a series of \\n task-force meetings; plans to improve quality get no farther \\n than some airy rhetoric and the hiring of a \"quality guru\"; \\n and plans to become the low-cost producer bog down when \\n corporate officers balk at expensive outlays for plant modern- \\n ization. In short, many of our strategies simply aren\\'t happen- \\n ing. Without successful implementation, a strategy is but a \\n fantasy. This problem - how to convert a new strategy into \\n concrete competitive success - is what managers now need \\n frameworks for, and is the focus of our article. \\n Actually, the widespread inability to implement stra- \\n tegy may be a sign that accepted approaches to strategy \\n formulation are not as good as many think they are, for a \\n well-conceived strategy is one that is implementable. For \\n that reason, implementation must be considered during the \\n formulation process, not later, when it may be too late. A \\n tendency to treat formulation and implementation as two \\n separate phases is at the root of many failed strategies.2 \\n Regrettably, the recent trend among consultants and busi- \\n ness schools to treat strategy formulation as being primarily \\n based on industry and product/market economics exacer- \\n bates the schism. \\n The strategist will not be able to nail down every \\n action step when the strategy is first crafted - nor, as we will \\n later argue, should this even be attempted. However, he or \\n she must have the ability to look ahead at the major imple- \\n mentation obstacles and ask, \"Is this strategy workable? Can I \\n make it happen?\" If an honest assessment yields \"no\" or \\n \"only at an unacceptable risk,\" then the formulation process \\n must continue. A great strategy is only great if it can actually \\n be carried out. Thus, the guidelines we offer in this article \\n about implementation must be in the mindset of the strate- \\n gist even at the earliest formulation stages. \\n Our ideas about strategy implementation have \\n evolved on the basis of situations we have observed in \\n numerous firms, as well as a long and careful reading of the \\n literature on the topic.3 However, our thoughts have been \\n crystallized and clarified particularly by a recent opportunity \\n to study several successful and unsuccessful implementa- \\n tions of business strategies in a large multibusiness firm. The \\n top management of this company, which we will call Globus, \\n had concluded that the major difference between competi- \\n tive success and failure for its business units lay more in \\n matters of strategy implementation than formulation, and \\n they sought to understand the common ingredients of their \\n own most effective business strategy implementations. At \\n Globus, we had an opportunity to examine a broad range of \\n plans for strategic change - for achieving low cost position, \\n going global, consolidating, and others. Here, we will draw \\n on one of the businesses we studied - the Bondall Division \\n to illustrate the very persuasive, recurring themes we \\n observed. \\n Succinctly put, and portrayed in Exhibit 1, these were \\n the patterns of behavior for the effective strategy implemen- \\n ters at Bondall and the other units we studied: \\n 1. Obtain broad-based inputs and participation at \\n the formulation stage. \\n 2. Carefully and deliberately assess the obstacles to \\n implementation. \\n 3. Make early, first-cut moves across the full array of \\n implementation levers - resource commitments, subunit \\n policies and programs, structure, people, and rewards. \\n 4. Sell, sell, sell the strategy to everyone who matters \\n upward, downward, across, and outward. \\n 5. Steadily fine tune, adjust, and respond as events \\n and trends arise. \\n 278\\nThis content downloaded from \\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0014.139.123.61 on Tue, 16 Nov 2021 05:53:52 UTC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms'),\n",

Bondall had five plants spread across North \\n America, totaling 40% of industry capacity. With these plants \\n located near major customers, Bondall had competed on the \\n basis of price and reliable delivery, emphasizing the com- \\n modity segment of the industry; it had always let customers \\n seek out their own applications for ACP. As Will Langston, \\n the division\\'s general manager, said, \"This has always been a \\n tankcar business - we sell carloads full of this stuff. What \\n customers do with it, or might do with it, has never been our \\n concern. The one exception is our New Jersey plant, \\n acquired two years ago, which has a substantial customer \\n application and product R&D section.\" \\n In 1982, two competitors built large plants with a \\n radical new process technology, plunging the industry into \\n dramatic oversupply and pulling down prices for what \\n seemed the long-term future. It became clear that Bondall \\n could no longer be profitable in the commodity segment of \\n the business. Building new plants with the new process \\n technology was out of the question, since Globus (the par- \\n ent) was not willing to place large investments in mature \\n businesses. After several weeks of analysis and discussion, \\n Bondall management decided on a new strategic direction. \\n Their plan was to deemphasize the traditional commodity \\n segment and largely remake the entire business in the like- \\n ness of the New Jersey facility, with a major emphasis on \\n higher value-added, differentiated customer problem solv- \\n ing through the use of ACP.  As part of this plan, management knew the business \\n would have to shrink; in fact, they planned to close the two \\n least efficient plants within a year. They also decided to shift \\n the mix of commodity/speciality business as follows: \\n Targets Under Bondall\\'s New Strategy \\n 1982 1984 1986 \\n Sales ($ millions) \\n Commodity 200 100 60 \\n Specialty 20* 60 100 \\n Total 220 160 160 \\n Number of plants 5 3 3 \\n Return on assets (%) 10 15 22 \\n (before taxes) \\n *AII from New Jersey unit \\n This strategy then fell clearly in line with what Porter4 \\n called a differentiation strategy and Miles and Snow5 referred \\n to as a prospector strategy. From these authors and others, \\n we know what an organization will tend to look like once \\n such a strategy is implemented, but we have little in the way \\n of insights or frameworks for getting the organization into its \\n new configuration; that is, how does the organization get \\n from here to there? \\n Langston, following an approach similar to that used \\n by other effective strategy implementers we have observed, \\n met with great success. By the end of 1987, Bondall\\'s sales \\n were $200 million, with about $150 million coming from \\n specialty products. Return on assets that year was 22%. The \\n business developed a highly sophisticated marketing re- \\n search and customer application capability, identifying and \\n attracting numerous customers that had never used ACP \\n before. \\n 279\\nThis content downloaded from \\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0014.139.123.61 on Tue, 16 Nov 2021 05:53:52 UTC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Strategy_Implementation_as_substance_and_selling.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content=' November, 1989 \\n At the outset, Bondall management clearly had a \\n significantly new strategy in mind. The way in which they \\n went on to implement it serves as an archetypal example of \\n the key elements of effective strategic change we observed \\n in our research: astute preliminary groundwork; prompt, \\n broad-gauged, substantive initiatives; and a lot of selling. \\n Preliminary Groundwork \\n Broa(d-BasedI lInputs on Formulationl \\n One of the most effective aids to implementation is to \\n involve people early on in the development and debate of \\n strategic options. In essence, then, implementation is de- \\n pendent on the process that is used for formulation. It may \\n not be possible to obtain universal agreement with a new \\n strategic direction, but widespread inputs improve the qual- \\n ity of the choices, raise critical implementation issues, and \\n make the involved individuals more receptive to the new \\n strategy, once chosen. This wisdom is so well known that it \\n requires little elaboration here.6 \\n Langston used two major approaches to securing \\n early, broad-based inputs on a new strategy. First, he formed \\n two senior-level, multifunctional task forces to work in paral- \\n lel (hence, essentially competitively) to analyze the busi- \\n ness\\'s strategic situation and make recommendations. His \\n premise, borne out, was that the strategic facts and options \\n were so clear-cut that both groups would arrive at essentially \\n the same broad game plan. However, he felt that widespread \\n participation would secure their intellectual and social \\n commitment to the new course of action, as well as highlight \\n the major issues expected to arise during implementation. \\n The second thing Langston did to secure early input \\n was to meet individually with the 30 people he considered \\n most critical to the success of any new strategy. Langston \\n typically met with these individuals in their offices, with the \\n express purpose of asking them where they thought the \\n business should go and what they saw as the key implications \\n of various approaches he was considering. (There was some \\n overlap between these 30 people and the membership of \\n the task forces.) Even though the one-on-one format was \\n time consuming, Langston considered it critical since it \\n allowed each person to speak his or her mind, conveyed a \\n greater sense of individualism and intimacy, and allowed \\n Langston to close each meeting by securing a commitment: \\n \"Jim, I hear you. Those are legitimate concerns. I\\'m not sure \\n what we\\'ll decide, but I know for sure that we will need your \\n support whichever way we go. Can I count on it?\" To a \\n person, all 30 pledged their support to an unknown strategic \\n direction. While not all would be delighted by it when it was \\n finally announced, it would be very difficult, both psycholog- \\n ically and interpersonally, for any one to then block or \\n otherwise sabotage the new direction when it was \\n underway.\\' \\n Deliberate Assessment of Obstacles \\n The strategist must comprehend that the implemen- \\n tation setting is not benign. A variety of obstacles - gener- \\n ally known but just as generally overlooked - can and will \\n intervene to prevent the new strategy from unfolding. The \\n effective strategist has a careful understanding of these \\n obstacles. Langston even went so far as to develop a written \\n inventory and analysis of the key barriers his new strategy \\n would face. We will not (lescribe Langston\\'s inventory here, \\n only its three major categories: internal obstacles, external \\n obstacles, and the parent company. \\n Internal Obstacles. The success of a strategy primarily \\n depends on marshalling resources within the business itself. \\n Human and material limitations make this difficult: The busi- \\n ness may have the wrong configurations of physical re- \\n sources, human resources, and systems and procedures. Of \\n equal importance, however, is the fact that there will be \\n internal resistance to correcting these deficiencies. Political \\n resistance arises from individuals who feel they stand to lose \\n something of value if the new strategy is implemented; \\n ideological resistance arises from those who believe the new \\n strategy is ill-fated or in violation of deeply held values; and \\n blind resistance arises from those who are intolerant or afraid \\n of change. \\n External Obstacles. The strategist must also navigate \\n around obstacles outside the business unit. The most \\n obvious counterforce is competition, but the general eco- \\n nomic and technological environment can also intervene to \\n impede a new strategy. Less obvious sources of resistance are \\n allies such as suppliers, distributors, and trade associations. \\n These allies often have vested interests in the current strategy \\n of the business and can resist for the same reasons as do \\n those inside the firm. \\n Parent Company. A final potential obstacle is the \\n parent company. Corporate officials can impede implemen- \\n tation, even after approving the strategy in principle. The \\n parent\\'s own grand strategy may change, or it may simply \\n lose patience with or confidence in the new strategy. The \\n strategist must understand that there is nothing unfair about \\n the loss of corporate support: It is a reality. The parent is \\n under its own set of pressures and wants to put its resources \\n where they will do the most good. It is up to the strategist in \\n the business unit to keep corporate executives committed. \\n A Lot of Substance: Early Use of Implementation \\n Levers \\n Once the strategist has secured various inputs, settled \\n on the new strategy, and carefully assessed the major obsta- \\n cles, he or she is ready to start taking substantive implemen- \\n tation actions. Obviously, the number and types of imple- \\n mentation actions depend largely on situational specifics. \\n 280\\nThis content downloaded from \\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0014.139.123.61 on Tue, 16 Nov 2021 05:53:52 UTC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Strategy_Implementation_as_substance_and_selling.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=' Strategy Implementation as Substance and Selling \\n However, our study of successful and unsuccessful strategy \\n implementation allows some reliable identification of the \\n five major \"make-happen\" areas the strategist must con- \\n sider: resource commitments, subunit policies and pro- \\n grams, structure, rewards, and people. What we have found \\n is that the effective implementer makes significant use of all \\n these levers within the first three months of unveiling a new \\n strategy, without trying to anticipate with precision or detail \\n how all the levers might ultimately be configured. We will \\n inventory the major implementation questions that need to \\n be resolved and give examples of how Bondall dealt with \\n them. Systematically raising these questions brings focus to \\n the battle in developing a well-orchestrated implementation \\n plan.\\n Resource Commitments \\n What level of resources should be directed at each \\n product or market? \\n What level of resources should be placed behind \\n each competitive weapon? \\n Without exception, new strategies will require some \\n type of resource reallocation. Also, many new strategies will \\n have to provide for the acquisition of new resources. How- \\n ever, in addition to placing resources where they are most \\n needed, resource allocation sends signals both inside and \\n outside the firm. These signals provide proof of manage- \\n ment\\'s intentions to break with the past and \"get off the \\n dime\" under the new strategy. \\n At the outset of his new strategy, Langston made \\n several major resource allocation decisions: He closed two \\n old, inefficient plants, terminated numerous lower-margin \\n commodity customers, funded marketing research/ \\n customer application centers at two of the remaining plants, \\n and funded a major salesforce training program, among \\n others. Naturally, despite Langston\\'s early groundwork, \\n there was some resistance to these decisions since the firm \\n had always been the largest producer of ACP and had served \\n many high-volume (but lower-margin) customers for years. \\n The reallocation of resources signalled a sharp break with \\n tradition at Bondall and caused discomfort, particularly \\n among the salesforce. Some salespeople left the firm volun- \\n tarily, some were dismissed as part of the general downsizing \\n of the firm, and some worked hard to develop the compe- \\n tencies required by the new strategy. \\n Though often painful, the reallocation of resources is \\n crucial to the success of any new strategy. It is in the com- \\n mitment of resources that the strategy ceases to be merely a \\n paper plan or a gleam in the strategist\\'s eye. As unlikely as it \\n may sound, many strategies fail simply because resources are \\n not decisively reallocated at the outset in line with the new \\n direction\\'s requirements. \\n Subunit Policies and Programs \\n What actions will each subunit need to take? \\n According to what timetable and with what outlays? \\n The strategy of the business must be translated into \\n concrete action plans within the various subunits - be they \\n functional areas, product groups, or regions. Subunit poli- \\n cies and programs form the component pieces of the stra- \\n tegy, serving not just to implement it but also to reinforce \\n and bolster it so that attack from the competition becomes \\n more difficult. \\n For example, in the marketing function the strategy \\n should be converted into discrete plans and policies in the \\n areas of pricing, promotion, distribution, service, and sales- \\n force development. At Bondall, where a high value-added \\n segmentation strategy was developed, the new pricing pol- \\n icy was to not match competitors\\' price cuts but rather to \\n keep prices up and sell on the basis of quality, service, and \\n innovation. The new production scheduling policy was that \\n custom orders took precedence and commodity runs were \\n fit in residually, rather than the historical reverse. New sales- \\n force targets were based on profits, not volume. These sub- \\n unit policies were among the many proposed by department \\n heads in response to Langston\\'s early request for implemen- \\n tation plans from every department. Interestingly, he encour- \\n aged each head to implement only about half his or her \\n proposed change initiatives to avoid complete chaos. (We \\n will return shortly to this theme of moderation.) It is clear, \\n however, that strategy implementation occurs largely \\n through the creativity, initiative, and will of mid-level \\n managers. \\n Structure \\n How should roles and relationships be organized? \\n How should information flow and decisions get \\n made? \\n The new strategy will often require a revised physiol- \\n ogy for the organization. Groupings may need to be \\n changed, the hierarchy flattened, and more lateral relation- \\n ships established. The day-to-day way in which information \\n flows and decisions get made may have to change as well.8 \\n Langston reorganized Bondall considerably. He \\n created \"customer application teams\" oriented toward spe- \\n cific market segments, with each team consisting of sales, \\n marketing, and technical service people. Each team was also \\n supported by a mid-level production manager, who could \\n work with the team on technical issues, production schedul- \\n ing, and expediting. These teams were liberally sprinkled \\n with (but not dominated by) individuals reassigned from the \\n New Jersey operation who had substantial experience with \\n the customer team approach. \\n 281\\nThis content downloaded from \\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0014.139.123.61 on Tue, 16 Nov 2021 05:53:52 UTC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Strategy_Implementation_as_substance_and_selling.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content=' November, 1989 \\n Another major structural initiative was the creation of \\n a product development committee, consisting of application \\n team leaders and chaired by Langston, which met quarterly \\n to exchange technical, marketing, and organizational insights \\n and progress reports. The division also developed sophisti- \\n cated new computer software to analyze a multitude of \\n product/market segments. In short, the business was striving \\n to develop the information system and decision-making \\n protocols that would maximize the likelihood of success for \\n their chosen strategic theme of customized product offerings. \\n Rewards \\n What behaviors and outcomes should be rewarded? \\n What should be the types and amounts of rewards? \\n The impact of incentives and rewards is often over- \\n looked in strategy implementation. This is a substantial over- \\n sight since they are a major basis for redirecting the efforts of \\n individuals. Rewards can be formal (incentive schemes, \\n promotions, commissions) or informal (pats on the back, a \\n sense of pride, enthusiasm). The criteria for receiving \\n rewards can and should be tailored to the specific strategic \\n thrust of the business. Sometimes business units must oper- \\n ate within the confines of corporate compensation guide- \\n lines, thus reducing the degree of reward discretion avail- \\n able to the general manager. To overcome this restriction, \\n insight and creativity are essential to stimulating key \\n employees to support the implementation process. \\n At Bondall, requirements from the parent company \\n precluded large changes in the amounts of incentive pay. \\n However, criteria for earning bonuses were shifted dramati- \\n cally away from volume/market share to margins/profits \\n and, perhaps even more important, away from individual \\n performance to team performance. Assignment to certain \\n desirable application teams and to team leadership posts \\n were held out as important lures to motivate effort, creativ- \\n ity, and cooperation. The incentives for production man- \\n agers at all levels were altered to encourage their willingness \\n to do short, quick production runs instead of the long, \\n efficient runs to which they had been accustomed. New \\n product/market ideas, so central to the new strategy, were \\n not only encouraged but backed with the seed funds and \\n release time needed to try them out. \\n In the cases of the two plant closings, plant managers \\n were expressly told that they would be evaluated and \\n rewarded in large part on how well they managed the \\n employee and community relations associated with the clos- \\n ings. This heightened the managers\\' attention and sensitivity \\n and, when coupled with corporate support for severance \\n and outplacement arrangements, helped minimize the in- \\n evitable entanglements and costs associated with the \\n shutdowns. \\n People \\n What personal and professional (qualities will be \\n needed in the business? \\n How will these qualities be attained? \\n It is through the aptitudes, values, skills, and contacts \\n of individuals at all levels that strategies become successes. A \\n new strategy will almost inevitably change the optimal mix of \\n human resources for the business. The starting point is to \\n understand the nature of those required changes. Only then \\n can the strategist decide how to bring about the changes. \\n Replacement of individuals, additions to the team, training \\n and development programs, and personal coaching and \\n counseling are among the options available. \\n For example, at Bondall a number of new people with \\n certain combinations of technical and marketing skills had to \\n be hired or reassigned to staff the newly created market \\n groups. As noted earlier, people from the New Jersey unit \\n who were experienced in the new strategy were liberally \\n seeded into other units. Some new hires with experience in \\n customer application strategies came from other Globus \\n businesses. In addition, intensive training programs were \\n held to help marketing and salespeople develop their skills \\n in market segmentation, marketing of intangibles, and so on. \\n These five levers - resource commitments, subunit \\n policies and programs, structure, rewards, and people- \\n form the strategist\\'s implementation armament. They are the \\n substance of strategic change. The elements form an inter- \\n twined package and must reinforce each other. In fact, \\n among the successful implementations we have observed \\n (including the one at Bondall), the strategist has made at least \\n one significant change in each of the five levers within the \\n first three months of launching the implementation effort. \\n However, the need for orchestrated action on all five \\n fronts must not delay action until the last detail can be put in \\n place. Such a full-blown implementation plan will take too \\n long to develop and cannot be clearly envisioned at the \\n outset. Therefore, rather than initially exhausting all possible \\n moves, the strategist is better advised simply to be aware of \\n the array of implementation levers at his or her disposal, \\n make early critical changes in the levers, and then be pre- \\n pared to exercise them in subsequent \"waves.\" What we \\n argue for, then, is an initial broad-gauged burst of changes \\n across all the levers, followed by plenty of reinforcing and \\n fine-tuning changes. As shown in Exhibit 2, this puts us \\n squarely between the \"comprehensive, all-at-once\" and the \\n \"incremental\" schools of thought about the speed and \\n completeness of strategic change.9 \\n The Selling of Strategic Change \\n The new strategy, by its very nature, involves change. \\n The anxiety and resistance provoked by the change will arise \\n from parties who either have a vested interest in the old \\n strategy or cannot envision the yields from the new one. The \\n strategist thus faces a major selling job; that is, trying to build \\n and maintain support among key constituencies for a plan \\n 282\\nThis content downloaded from \\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0014.139.123.61 on Tue, 16 Nov 2021 05:53:52 UTC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms'),\n",

As the very successful Will Langston \\n of Bondall told us, \"We pulled this off by selling, selling, and \\n selling some more.\" These efforts of persuasion must pro- \\n ceed in four directions: upward to superiors, downward to \\n subordinates, across to other organizational units, and out- \\n ward to external stakeholders.10 \\n Selling Upward \\n Executives at the corporate level need to be sold on \\n the merits and viability of a strategy. As the stewards of \\n corporate resources, they expect to see careful analysis and \\n supporting data for the strategy, not only at the time it is \\n being proposed but also while it is being implemented. \\n Langston of Bondall had a very difficult task in selling \\n his strategic plan upward. The strategy called for a substantial \\n infusion of capital and other corporate resources, and it was \\n clearly at odds with the parent corporation\\'s belief that \\n Bondall was stuck in a stagnant, low-margin industry. The \\n proposal for new equipment at two Bondall plants was the \\n first major capital expenditure to be reviewed by the new \\n corporate CEO, who had stated clearly that growth busi- \\n nesses would be favored in the company\\'s capital allocation. \\n \"We made sure all the i\\'s were dotted and all the t\\'s crossed \\n for this one,\" a key Bondall executive said. \"We also worked \\n hard to pre-sell as many members of the corporate finance \\n committee as we could.\" \\n Not only did the initial approval require careful and \\n complete backup, but maintaining ongoing corporate sup- \\n port was a challenge. Soon after the initial approval of the \\n expansion, competitors caused the already low price of ACP \\n to drop even lower, and corporate officials were inclined to \\n halt the project. Bondall executives, however, developed a \\n computerized decision model complete with price, cost, \\n capacity, and demand variables built in. Using the model, \\n they could show on a day-by-day basis that the new strategy \\n was still a good choice. Their constant readiness to answer \\n questions and quantify options allowed them to maintain \\n credibility and ongoing corporate support for the project. \\n Selling Downward \\n Communicating with employees in the business is \\n the type of implementation selling about which we hear \\n most. Employees are the people who will make the strategy \\n work, and their full understanding is required. At Bondall, \\n many members of the management team had to be sold on \\n the new strategy since it meant a complete change of focus \\n and the potential loss of market share leadership. Once \\n commitment was gained, however, the management team \\n worked hard for the success of the overall strategy, and their \\n ideas and efforts were key to making the implementation a \\n success. \\n How did Will Langston conduct his internal selling \\n effort at Bondall? \\n \"I anticipated that there would be four \\n questions people would have on their minds and \\n expect answers for: \\n * Why do we have to change? \\n * Why is this the right change? \\n * Why do you think this organization can \\n handle the change? \\n * What are you going to do to help me \\n through the change? \\n \"I spent a lot of effort working up answers \\n for these questions. When they, or variations of \\n them, were asked, I had a well thought out, and I \\n hoped sincere, response. Even when they weren\\'t \\n asked, I assumed they were still on people\\'s \\n minds, and I would go into my selling pitch.\" \\n Of course, the news that must be shared with \\n employees is not always upbeat. Plant closures and employee \\n layoffs are particularly difficult. In closing two plants, Bondall \\n kept employees and community leaders abreast of its plans \\n and put significant outplacement and severance programs in \\n place to help contain what otherwise could have been a very \\n litigious and distracting episode. \\n Exhibit 2 \\n Three Approaches to the Timing of Strategy Implementation Initiatives \\n Number of \\n Implementation \\n Initiatives \\n * Time * Time * Time \\n A: Comprehensive/ B: Incremental C: Opening Burst With \\n \"All-at-Once\" Ample Follow-Up \\n *point of commitment to a new strategy \\n 283\\nThis content downloaded from \\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0014.139.123.61 on Tue, 16 Nov 2021 05:53:52 UTC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Strategy_Implementation_as_substance_and_selling.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content=' November, 1969 \\n Selling Across \\n A business unit is often dependent on other units of \\n the firm for services or assistance in strategy implementation. \\n For example, sister units that provide raw materials, technol- \\n ogy, sales, or services often need to be \"sold\" on the new \\n strategy and their role in it. \\n In addition to its own salesforce, Bondall relied par- \\n tially on a centralized salesforce, which was not under its \\n direct control, for reaching several specific markets. In the \\n minds of Bondall executives, this salesforce was already giv- \\n ing ACP too little attention compared with other products it \\n handled. Now, with the closing of plants located near cus- \\n tomers, the centralized salesforce started expressing a com- \\n plete disinterest in ACP. \\n Denise Williams, Bondall\\'s marketing manager, de- \\n signed and initiated a \"sales\" program directed solely at \\n gaining the support of these individuals outside her direct \\n authority. Williams felt that educating the salespeople about \\n ACP and its range of customer applications would be one \\n way to improve their effectiveness with customers. She \\n brought sales personnel to Bondall headquarters for product \\n seminars, which included introduction to the staff and appli- \\n cation team leaders, technical details of the business unit, \\n and explanation of the various marketing and production \\n strategies. The increased attention given to the outside sales- \\n force stimulated them to give more attention to ACP. \\n Williams was convinced of the importance of calling \\n on customers frequently; however, convincing the outside \\n sales managers to establish a minimum calling rate was no \\n easy task. Looking back, Williams said she was successful in \\n this endeavor by using the same marketing technique inter- \\n nally that she used in the marketplace: She made regular \\n \"calls\" on the central sales managers. The payoff was an extra \\n effort on their part in selling ACP. \\n Selling Outward \\n The strategist relies on external constituencies for \\n success in implementation. These external parties are no \\n different from insiders in their potential for skepticism and \\n anxiety about the new strategy. The effective implementer \\n will be alert to these problems and develop means for over- \\n coming them. \\n When Bondall was preparing to close its two out- \\n dated plants, executives reassured desired customers about \\n reliable delivery by testing supply lines from the remaining \\n plants. The tests convinced customers that delivery from \\n more distant locations would be effective. \\n A major problem faced by Bondall was to maintain its \\n image as a major producer in the industry in spite of having \\n to close two plants. To address the problem, a two-part \\n campaign was undertaken. First, ads in the print media con- \\n centrated on the new initiatives and capabilities at the three \\n remaining plants. Second, an aggressive mail campaign was \\n conducted to reach present and potential customers. As \\n Denise Williams noted, the campaign represented a major \\n change from Bondall\\'s customary reliance on industry \\n journals:  \"This way, we kept our name on the cu-stomers \\n desks during a difficult time. The information was \\n sent in the form of monthly \\'Bondall Newslet- \\n ters.\\' This effort, in conjunction with prinit a(dver- \\n tising and steppe(d up activity fronm our press \\n people, gave the impression that Bonrdall was \\n expanding, committed, niot cutting back.\\' \\n Customers are not the only external party that can \\n influence a strategy\\'s chances for success. Regulatory bodies, \\n the media, and suppliers are additional examples. In their \\n plant-closing situations, Bondall\\'s management team was \\n very effective at minimizing the negative fallout. Careful \\n planning of employee relations and community relations \\n resulted in a smooth series of events. Workers, the media, \\n and public officials were kept well informed. In return, the \\n business avoided unfavorable treatment in the media. \\n Summary, and One More Theme \\n So far, we have stressed two broad elements of effec- \\n tive strategy implementation. We have examined the sub- \\n stantive levers the strategist draws on to make the strategy \\n happen and we have discussed the active, broad-based sell- \\n ing and communication that must occur to gain support \\n from otherwise resistant or skeptical constituencies. These \\n two elements of implementation could have been drawn \\n from many quarters. The patterns have been supported by \\n examples from the successful experience at Bondall. How- \\n ever, examples are widely applicable, characterizing the \\n options and issues resolved by a number of successful strate- \\n gists we have observed in various types of organizations. \\n However, we have seen one additional theme as well, \\n and that is the marked tendency for successful implementers \\n to get on with the implementation process. They are doers, \\n action takers; they are not necessarily impulsive, but they do \\n not attempt to wait until they have identified every potential \\n contingency before beginning to take action. The effective \\n strategist establishes a broad theme and makes several \\n immediate reinforcing decisions across the array of levers we \\n have discussed. Then, he or she vigilantly waits until circum- \\n stances unfold to identify other decisions that need to be \\n made. All these later decisions serve to reinforce the original \\n broad theme - be it cost leadership, product innovation, \\n global expansion, or some other basis for competing. \\n Why is this approach - an opening burst of support- \\n ing initiatives with an ample stream of follow-up actions - a \\n hallmark of effective strategists? Let\\'s turn the question the \\n other way: What are the deficiencies of the alternative \\n approaches? Why is the development of a fully exhaustive \\n and comprehensive implementation plan at the outset of a \\n new strategy usually ineffective? First of all, because it\\'s a stall. \\n Despite the illusion that this approach brings quick action, in \\n reality a quest for an exhaustive implementation plan takes a \\n long time and greatly postpones the changes that are \\n needed. Second, it\\'s unrealistic. All contingencies and even- \\n tualities cannot be envisioned at the outset. Finally, a seem- \\n ingly airtight plan takes on an air of sanctity and authenticity \\n that makes spontaneous correction very difficult for the \\n architect to handle psychologically. \\n 284\\nThis content downloaded from \\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x0014.139.123.61 on Tue, 16 Nov 2021 05:53:52 UTC\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00 \\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms'),\n",

Its biggest shortcoming is that it does \\n not provide the new strategic thrust with enough early rein- \\n forcement. The opportunity to create organizational energy \\n and momentum in support of the new direction is squan- \\n dered if early initiatives are modest in either scope or magni- \\n tude. In fact, an announcement of strategic change without \\n prompt and substantial supporting actions evokes a wither- \\n ing cynicism in an organization, which even artful strategists \\n then have difficulty overcoming. \\n A close understanding of implementation successes \\n reveals that the strategists set out with broad game plans in \\n mind but were flexible, open-minded, and always on the \\n lookout for the problems the new strategy would be creating \\n and for ways of solving those problems. These strategists \\n were opportunists in the most positive sense of the word. \\n They had broad guidance systems, but were spontaneous \\n and responsive as trtuly successful strategists must be.

As John Kotter pointed out in his book, The General \\n Managers (New York: Free Press, 1982), the effective general manager \\n typically has a network of hundreds or even thousands of individuals \\n through whom he or she can influence others. Obviously, some contacts  are more important than others; if the general manager has not established \\n the critical contacts, then the supporting management team must be \\n selected to offset that deficiency. \\n Donald C.
